Some fun files:

cyclic.wim:  This WIM has an image with a cyclic directory structure and should be
detected as invalid.

duplicate_names.wim:  This WIM has an image with multiple files with the same
name in the same directory, and should be detected as invalid.

dotdot.wim:  This WIM has an image with the path
/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd, and should be
detected as invalid.  (Fun fact: WIMGAPI is dumb and will extract .. files, and
requires running with Admin rights, so given a malicious WIM file it will
overwrite arbitrary files on the target drive.)

longpaths.wim:  This WIM has an image with a path longer than MAX_PATH on Windows.
This should still be extracted successfully.

empty_dacl.wim:  This WIM has an image containing file with a security
descriptor having an empty DACL.  This is valid and should be extracted
successfully.
